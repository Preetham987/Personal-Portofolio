      <h3>Project 1 : Traffic accident detection </h3>
      <p>The objectives of this project include:<br>
        a. Developing an accident detection system using YOLO for real-time analysis of video
        sequences.<br>
        b. Training the YOLO model on a comprehensive dataset of labelled video frames to
        enable accurate accident detection.<br>
        c. Evaluating the performance of the system in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and
        response time.<br>
        d. Integrating the system with notification mechanisms to alert relevant authorities
        promptly.<br>
        e. Assessing the potential impact of the system on reducing accident severity and
        improving emergency response.</p>
